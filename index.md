I'm a machine learning researcher focusing specializing on the empirical study of deep learning models to improve their reliability in high stakes domains such as healthcare.
At Brown University, I work with my PhD advisor, [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/),  studying the inductive bias of overparamterized models.  For the past two summers, I have collaborated with [Michela Paganini](https://mickypaganini.github.io/) at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) on model pruning.  Prior to starting my PhD, I was an active core maintainer at [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which maintains open source projects such as the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).  I also worked as a Data Scientist, collaborating with colleagues at organizations such as McKinsey and DARPA.   

I believe that the open science movement is important to improving transparency and accountability in machine learning. At [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) I co-maintained reproducibility tools such as [binder](https://mybinder.org) and [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  I also am a co-organizer of the [Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/) and [Machine Learning Retrospectives](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/).  This fall, I will also be co-organizing a [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc) workshop on negative results in probabilistic machine learning, [I Can't Believe It's Not Better!](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/Schedule?showEvent=16124)

Email me at jessica_forde at brown.edu.  

Fun Fact: My [Project Jupyter code](https://jupyter.org/) is in the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/), 250 meters underground in a former coal mine in Svalbard, Norway.
